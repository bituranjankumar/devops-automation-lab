# GitHub Actions: Basic CI Example  

This folder contains a simple GitHub Actions workflow for a sample application. The workflow demonstrates basic CI tasks:  

- Check out the repository using the official checkout action.  
- Set up a runtime environment (for example Python).  
- Install dependencies.  
- Run tests or linting commands.  

The workflow file `ci.yml` can be referenced as a starting point for building your own CI pipelines.
